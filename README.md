# NetDuino-.Net-MicroFramwork-HomeSecuritySystem-Sensors
Home security system on NetDuino microcontroller 


The system detects movements, measures temperature and distance using sensors. When certain interruption occurs, it triggers proper action. The project was built with Netduino microcontroller, which is connected to internet via Lan module. All data and interruptions from the microcontroller where pulled and presented on website, using sockets built into .NET Microframework.

Toolset:
.NET Micro Framework | C# | NETduino microcontroller

Notable features:
- Observer pattern
- Multithreding
- Sensors
